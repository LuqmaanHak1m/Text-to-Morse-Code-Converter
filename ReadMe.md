# Text to Morse Code Converter

This Python script converts a given text input into Morse code and plays the corresponding sounds using the `winsound` module.

## Features

- Converts text input (both letters and numbers) into Morse code.
- Plays the Morse code using beeps for dots and dashes.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Windows OS (since the script uses `winsound` which is specific to Windows)

## Setup

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. If not, download and install Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text-to-morse-converter.git
   cd text-to-morse-converter
   ```

2. **Run the script:**

   ```sh
   python text_to_morse.py
   ```

3. **Input Text:**
   When prompted, enter the text you want to convert to Morse code. The script will remove any spaces from the input and convert the remaining characters to Morse code.
   ```sh
   Enter text for conversion: hello123
   ```

# Text to Morse Code Converter Explanation

## Overview

This Python script converts a given text input into Morse code and plays the corresponding sounds using the `winsound` module. It is designed to run on Windows due to its dependency on `winsound` for audio output.

## Key Components

### Constants

- **MORSE**: A list that maps numbers (0-9) and letters (a-z) to their respective Morse code representations.
- **FREQUENCY**: The frequency of the sound in kHz (multiplied by 1000).
- **DOT_LENGTH**: The length of a dot sound in seconds.
- **DASH_LENGTH**: The length of a dash sound in seconds.
- **TIME_BETWEEN_PARTS_OF_THE_SAME_LETTER**: Time gap between parts of the same Morse code letter.
- **TIME_BETWEEN_LETTERS**: Time gap between different Morse code letters.

### Functions

- **`textToMorse(text: str) -> list`**: Converts input text into Morse code. Spaces are removed, and each character is converted to its Morse code representation based on the `MORSE` constant.
- **`morseToSound(text: str)`**: Takes the Morse code generated by `textToMorse` and plays the corresponding sounds using `winsound.Beep()`.

### User Interaction

1. **Input**: The script prompts the user to enter text for conversion.
2. **Conversion**: The entered text is converted into Morse code using `textToMorse`.
3. **Sound Output**: The converted Morse code is then played as audible beeps using `winsound.Beep()`.

### Notes

- Ensure the input text does not contain any special characters or spaces, as they are not handled by the current implementation.
- The winsound module is specific to Windows. The script will not work on other operating systems without modification.
